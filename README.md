## Original idea of Emiliano Ocariz
## Restyled, updated and extended functionalities by Cristian Sarabia

This project started two years ago in a Udemy front-end course for React+Redux+ECS6
I worked tipping the example of that course and, when I passed it, I was able to improve some features like rest-Api, error control with propTypes, routing...

## Future updates
:: I'll make an ajax searcher which let select any city near in the future.
:: I will add some extra features to the forecast extended as the tides and the sunrise time.
